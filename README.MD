## Project Notes:

Motivation:
- Lack of academic advisors at universities, few advising appointments around registration time. If advisors spend less time building schedules they have more time to help with career/preofessional development.

- Limitations: Currently only functional and accurate for the Computer Science Major. Terminal interaction only.
